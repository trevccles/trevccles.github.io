        <p>I was given the opportunity to work a 4th of July job for security. There was thousands of people and only about 20 guards. Luckily armed law enforcement was there to assist us. The best part was the firework show at the end.</p>

        <p>The Hyphen group at my church (ages 18 to married), went on a trip this fall to the bay area. We stayed in beach houses for the weekend and went to the beach every day. We went on a boat ride in the bay, and walked around all the shops. The best part for me was taking sunset pictures on the beach with my friends.
